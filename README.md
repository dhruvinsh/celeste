This is my Keychron Q8 keyboard. It is first mechanical keyboard (custom one) ANSI keyboard. This is my take on the firmware with _vial_ support. Since my main machine is Windows system I am not planning to use MAC switches at all.

## Keycaps

Currently I am using stock keycaps. List of keys are as below:

| Key Size  | # of Keys |
| --------- | --------: |
| 1u        |        56 |
| 1.25u     |         3 |
| 1.5u      |         2 |
| 1.75u     |         2 |
| 2u        |         1 |
| 2.25u     |         3 |
| 2.75u     |         1 |
| **Total** |    **68** |

Apart from these 68 keys there is one knob as well.

## Switches

It is using stock switches **Gateron G Pro Brown**.
